Supplementary code for the calculation of $Q$ values for multi-component discs of stars and gas. Our new definition $Q_\delta$ (where $\delta$ can be chosen) can be calculated, as well as the existing definition $Q_\mathrm{Rk}$ (Rafikov 2001, Romeo 2013).
The input quantities required by this calculation are the local epicycle frequency $\kappa$ and the local surface densities and sound speeds/velocity dispersions of all gas and stellar components.
Each quantity should be multiplied by the correct unit defined in the second cell (original c++ code written by Walter Dehnen, 1995/1996)
